## About

The Glaucal association is based in Courfaivre, in the Swiss Jura. It manages an independent space conducive to artistic creation, mainly musical. In 2023, it celebrates its 15th anniversary (crystal anniversary). On this occasion, Josué and Pascal conceived what would become the Cristal Session: three days of live recordings open to everyone.
From September 29 to October 1, 2023, about twenty people gathered to improvise and record twenty tracks played spontaneously and without constraints.

We are happy to share them with you in the form of a lovely jukebox illustrated by Valentine Moser and put online by Raphaël Saunier.

Recorded live by Pascal Lopinat & Josué Salomon @ Glaucal

## How to run

`yarn` and `yarn start` locally.
`yarn build` to build it (n.b. you'll have to copy some static files manually because Parcel does some weird shit).
Source files (not included in this repo) are converted to the most compact and cross-browser compatible format with FFMPEG commands in `convert.sh`

Most of the funcionality lovingly vibe-coded with Claude 4 Sonnet and Gemini 2.5 Pro, using the bare minimum of Vanilla JS dependencies.
